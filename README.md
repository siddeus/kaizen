## Installation

Downloading and Loading a Chrome Extension in the Browser

1. Clone or Download the Extension from the Repository
Download the repository as a ZIP:

Look for a "Code" or "Download" button, and select Download ZIP.
Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

2. Prepare the Extension Files
Ensure that the folder contains a file named manifest.json, which is required by Chrome extensions.
All other files, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and assets (like icons), should be in the same folder as the manifest.

3. Type chrome://extensions/
in the address bar and press Enter.

4. Enable Developer Mode
Once youâ€™re on the Extensions page, enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the upper right corner of the page.
This will enable extra options for loading unpacked extensions.

5. Load the Extension as an Unpacked Extension
Click on the Load unpacked button that appears once Developer Mode is enabled.
A file dialog will open. Navigate to the folder where you extracted or cloned the extension files.
Select the folder that contains the manifest.json file, then click Select Folder (or Open).
